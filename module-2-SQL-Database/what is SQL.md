      delete from users where name='vishal';
      
      ```   


3. delete will be used to delete using in operator 

      ```
      delete from users where user_id in (3,5);
      
      ```   

      
4. delete will be used to delete using between 

      ```
      delete from users where user_id between 5 and 100;
      
      ```   

      **Note**
      after delete we will rollback our data using TCL


# update the rows or data 

  **update**

  ```
  update users set name='umang',age=35 where user_id=3;
  ```
 

# DQL 
  DQL stands for data query language
  DQL is used to fetch(select) data from tables 
  
  **select**

  1. select all data 

    ```
    select * from users;
    ```
    
  2. select particular  data from id 

    ```
    select * from users where user_id=2;
    ```

    
  3. select particular data from column name

    ```
    select user_id , name from users;
    or 
    
    select user_id , name from users where user_id=5;
    ```

  4. select data apply limit 

     ```
     select * from users where user_id limit 0,2;
     or
     select * from users where user_id limit 2,2;
     or
     select * from users where user_id limit 2,2;
     or

       A group by is always work on group of columns 

      ```
       select sum(salary),department from flip_users group by department;
      ```   


      **having**
      having is used to filter data after group by 

      ```
       select sum(salary),department from flip_users group by department having sum(salary)>50000;
      ```      

      **like**
      1. like is used to filter data using pattern matching
      2. like is used to search for specific column data using wildcards 

       **wildcards**
       1. % (percent) : represents zero or more characters
       2. _ (underscore) : represents a single character

       **examples**
      ```
       select * from users where name like 'b%';
       or
       select * from users where name like '%a%';
       or
       select * from users where name like '%a';
       or
       select * from users where name like '_a%';
      ```


## what is sql function
   sql function is used to perform some operations on data and return a single value 
   
   **types of sql function**
   1. aggregate function 
   2. scalar function

   **aggregate function**
   1. count() : count is used to count the number of rows in a table
   2. sum() : sum is used to calculate the total of a numeric column
   3. avg() : avg is used to calculate the average of a numeric column
   4. min() : min is used to find the minimum value in a numeric column
   5. max() : max is used to find the maximum value in a numeric column

   **examples of aggregate function**
   ```
   select count(*) from users;
   or
   select sum(salary) from users;
   or
   select sum(salary) as total_sum_salary from flip_users;
   or
   select avg(salary) as average_salary from flip_users;
   or
   select min(salary) from flip_users;
   or
   select max(salary) from flip_users;
   or
   select department , sum(salary) as total_salary from flip_users group by department; 
   or
   select department , avg(salary) as average_salary from flip_users group by department;
   or
   select department , min(salary) as minimum_salary from flip_users group by department;
   or
   select department , max(salary) as maximum_salary from flip_users group by department;
   or
   select department , count(*) as total_employee from flip_users group by department;
   or
   select department , count(*) as total_employee from flip_users group by department having count(*)>2;
   or
   select department , sum(salary) as total_salary from flip_users group by department having sum(salary)>50000;
   or
   select department , avg(salary) as average_salary from flip_users group by department having avg(salary)>60000;
   or
   select department , min(salary) as minimum_salary from flip_users group by department having min(salary)>50000;

   ```

   **find second highest salary**
    find second highest salary from table used subquery

   ```
   select max(salary) from flip_users where salary < (select max(salary) from flip_users);
   ```


   **scalar function**
   1. upper() : upper is used to convert a string to uppercase
   2. lower() : lower is used to convert a string to lowercase
   3. length() : length is used to find the length of a string
   4. now() : now is used to return the current date and time
   5. date() : date is used to return the current date
   6. time() : time is used to return the current time

   Note: first we will create a table and insert some data then we will apply sql function on that data to understand better

   Note: lastly we will learn about TCL (transactional control language) in next file


   **examples of scalar function**
   ```
   select upper(name) from users;
   or
   select lower(name) from users;
   or
   select length(name) from users;
   or
   select now() from users;
   or
   select date() from users;
   or
   select time() from users;
   or
   select name , upper(name) as uppercase_name from users;
   or
   select name , lower(name) as lowercase_name from users;
   or
   select name , length(name) as name_length from users;
   or
   select name , now() as current_datetime from users;
   or
   select name , date() as current_date from users;
   or
   select name , time() as current_time from users;
   
   ```

  alter table users add unique (email);
```
              
  4. not null : not null is used to ensure that a column cannot have a null value
  5. default : default is used to provide a default value for a column when no value is specified

## TCL (transactional control language)
1. TCL stands for transactional control language
2. TCL is used to manage transactions in a database

4. TCL is used to rollback a transaction in case of an error
5. TCL is used to commit a transaction to make it permanent in the database


   1. **commit** : commit is used to save the changes made by a transaction to the database

     **syntax**
     ```
       commit;
   ```

   2. **rollback** : rollback is used to undo the changes made by a transaction in case of an error

     ```
       rollback;
   ```

   **examples of commit and rollback**
   ```
   start transaction;
   delete from users where user_id=2;
   commit;

   delete from users where user_id=1;
   rollback;

   ```
 
   **Note:mysql is not support rollback in structures**

6. create a table named "students" with the following columns: student_id (primary key), student_name, age, and country_id (foreign key referencing the country table).
7. insert at least 5 records into the students table.
8. create a table named "enrollments" with the following columns: enrollment_id (primary key), student_id (foreign key referencing the students table), course_id (foreign key referencing the courses table), and enrollment_date.
9. insert at least 5 records into the enrollments table.

10. write a query to select all enrollments along with student names and course names.
11. write a query to find the total number of students enrolled in each course.
12. write a query to find the faculty member teaching the most courses.
13. write a query to update the department of a faculty member with a specific faculty_id.
14. write a query to delete a student with a specific student_id.

**Note: after creating database and tables you will insert some data in that tables then you will apply all the queries on that data to understand better**

 **solutions of students tables** 

```
create table tbl_student 
(
 student_id int AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
 studentname varchar(255),
 studentage int,
 phone bigInt,
 address text,
 grade varchar(255),
 faculty_id int REFERENCES tbl_faculty(faculty_id),
 department_id int REFERENCES tbl_department(department_id),
 country_id int REFERENCES tbl_country(country_id)   
)

1) select student with there countryname

select tbl_student .*, countryname from tbl_student join tbl_country on tbl_student.country_id=tbl_country.country_id;

or

select student_id,studentname,address,grade, countryname from tbl_student join tbl_country on tbl_student.country_id=tbl_country.country_id

2) select avg(studentage) as average_student_age from tbl_student

3) select avg(studentage) as average_student_age, studentage from tbl_student group by grade

4) select COUNT(student_id) as total_student from tbl_student group by country_id;

5) select COUNT(student_id) as total_student,countryname from tbl_student  join tbl_country on tbl_student.country_id=tbl_country.country_id group by countryname;

6) select studentname from tbl_student  where grade='A'

7) update tbl_student set grade='A' where student_id=4;

8) delete from tbl_student where student_id=4;

## what is Normalization in SQL 

   Normalization is a process where we normalize our tables for removed redundancy or dublicate format in tables.

   **types of Normalization**

   1. 1NF
   2. 2NF
   3. 3NF 
   4. 4NF

   **1NF**
   1NF is a normalization form in table to provides basic structures with PK(primary).


   **examples**

      ```
    create table country
    (
    country_id int AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
    country_name varchar(255)
    
    )

      ```
   

   **2NF**
   2NF is a normalization form in table to provides basic structures with PK(primary key) and provides a relation between one table to another table using FK(foreign key).


   **examples**

      ```
    create table country
    (
    country_id int AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
    country_name varchar(255)
    
    )

      ```

      ```
     create table users
    (
    user_id int AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
    country_id int REFERENCES country(country_id),
    name varchar(255),
    age int,
    address text 
    )
      ```

   **3NF**
   3NF is a normalization form in table to provides basic structures with PK(primary key) and provides a relation between one table to another table using FK(foreign key) with 3NF relations.

   **examples**

      ```
    create table country
    (
    country_id int AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
    country_name varchar(255)
    
    )

      ```
     ```
      create table department
    (
    department_id int AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
    dep_name varchar(255)
    
    )
     ``` 
     ```
     create table users
    (
    user_id int AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
    country_id int REFERENCES country(country_id),
    department_id int REFERENCES department(department_id),
    name varchar(255),
    age int,
    address text 
    )
      ```
   

## sql joins 

   sql join are used to join tables with match column data if data matched return and join tables if data not matched return null values.

## types of joins 

  1. join 
  2. inner join 
  3. outer join 
     1. left outer join 
     2. right outer join 
     3. full outer join(this is not support)
  4. cross join     

**examples of join**

 sql join are used to join tables with match column data if data matched return and join tables if data not matched return null values.

  ```
  select orders.*,customer_name,product_name from orders join customers on orders.customer_id=customers.customer_id join products on products.product_id=orders.product_id; 
  ```


  
**examples of innerjoin**

 sql join are used to join tables with match column data if data matched return and join tables if data not matched return null values.
 Note : almost join and inner join is same 
  ```
  select orders.*,customer_name,product_name from orders inner join customers on orders.customer_id=customers.customer_id inner join products on products.product_id=orders.product_id; 

  or

   select order_id,qty,customer_name,product_name from orders inner join customers on orders.customer_id=customers.customer_id inner join products on products.product_id=orders.product_id; 
  ```


  **outer join**
  1. left join 
  2. right join 
  3. full join 

  **left join** 
  left join  are matched column data from first table of left rows with second table of left rows if data matched return all with join if data not matched return null data.

  ``` 
   select orders.*,customer_name,product_name from orders left join customers on orders.customer_id=customers.customer_id  left join products on products.product_id=orders.product_id;
  ```
  

   **right join** 
    right join  are matched column data from second table of right rows with first table of right rows if data matched return all with right join if data not matched return null data.

    ``` 
    select orders.*,customer_name,product_name from orders right join customers on orders.customer_id=customers.customer_id  right join products on products.product_id=orders.product_id;

    or

    select customers.*,country_name from customers right join country on customers.country_id=country.country_id

     or
     Note : get and join customers name in orders who is never made any orders

     select orders.*,customer_name from orders right join customers on orders.customer_id=customers.customer_id
 
     ```

   **cross join**

   cross join is used to multiply a tables with numbers of rows and return dublicate data from tables 

   ```
   select * from customers cross join country;
   
   ```


   **what is distinct**

   select the diffrent values from tables 

   **examples**

   ```
   SELECT DISTINCT address from tbl_student
   ```

   **what is enum data types**

   enum stands for en enumurated data types stored multiples values 

   ```
   create table users
    (
    user_id int AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
    country_id int REFERENCES country(country_id),
    department_id int REFERENCES department(department_id),
    name varchar(255),
    age int,
    address text,
    status enm("pending","approved","rejected") not null default "pending" 
    )

   ```

# what is view

   A view is used to create a dublicate or clone of  tables 
   A view is used to hide some data from some users there we create 
   A view can be insert | delete | update 
   A view also effect origin tables 

   **examples**

   **How to create view**

   ```
   create view view_flip_users as select user_id,name,password  from flip_users where user_id in (1,3,5);
   ``` 

   **insert | delete | update view**

   ```
   select * from view_flip_users;
   
   select `data_analytics_flipkart`.`flip_users`.`user_id` AS `user_id`,`data_analytics_flipkart`.`flip_users`.`name` AS `name`,`data_analytics_flipkart`.`flip_users`.`password` AS `password` from `data_analytics_flipkart`.`flip_users` where `data_analytics_flipkart`.`flip_users`.`user_id`

   ```

# what is index

  An index is used to performed or fast search optimization sql tables data
  An index create for fast search data from tables 
  An index is created for optimized speed of tables data 
  A index is applied its look up fast search data from tables 

  **create an index**
  
  **single index**

  ```
    create index indx_name on flip_users(name);  
  ```

  **composite index set on multiple columns**
  ```
    create index ind on flip_users(user_id,password,salary,department);  
  ```
